Just got out of watching Marching Powder and, honestly, my head's spinning like a washing machine on a caffeine high. I’m not even sure if I loved it or if I’m just overwhelmed with the spirit of chaos it served on a rusty platter. Seriously, I had no idea Bolivian prisons were like that. Who needs Netflix when real life is this bonkers, right? I mean, no wonder people are saying, Hey, should I download the movie?

The absurdity of it all — it’s like, are these people for real? Thomas McFadden, the main guy, he’s like a dodgy tour guide in a place where you'd definitely lose your passport and sanity before lunchtime. His charisma is as patchy as my old pickup truck and twice as exhausting. Just watching him wrangle his way through that prison made me feel like I’d run a marathon in clown shoes. How can drugs and prison tours fit into the same sentence? It’s mad. 

And the infuriating part? Feeling like I should be mildly horrified but there I was, kinda rooting for this guy. Am I losing it? Or is the real problem that these drug lords have more humor and humanity than politicians do on the best of days? Maybe I've just inhaled too much bleach working on that jammed up sink last week.

> The entire setup felt like a real-life surreal rollercoaster, with highs so high you could touch a satellite and lows so low, I'm surprised it didn’t dig into the Earth's core. Tourism in a prison, I don't know—is it insane or genius? Or just laughs in the face of disaster capitalism? The whole film felt like a joke without a punchline but somehow, you’re still left chuckling, just awkwardly.

And what was up with the camera work? Sometimes it was like looking through a pair of glasses you found on the pavement. Makes your eyes feel like they’re playing pinball with your brain. Maybe they were going for that raw feel, but man, a little polish wouldn’t have gone amiss. Still, it makes you wonder—who needs CGI when you’ve got gritty reality served up on a plate of crazy?

def prison_escape(day):
    return 'No escape today!' if day % 7 == 0 else 'Just plan it.'

I walked out feeling like I needed a shower, not just physically but mentally. Like I could wash away the grit and intensity—gotta scrub it all down the drain like last month’s plumbing disaster. So, if you get a chance, watch the movie—just maybe keep a plumber on speed dial, 'cause this one's bound to clog up your brainpipes for a little while.
